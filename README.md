# Chat Example

A chat made using [node](https://nodejs.org/) together with some dependencies (see [package.json](package.json)) and socket.io

The chat has the possibility to just inform and user and you already can work with it, having a mongodb link so the messages can be saved and showed when someone logs in.

## Installation

Just download the project and run an ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` so that you can install all dependecies needed. After that just run node in the index.js file in root folder and open the browser on the port informed in it.

## Things to Improve
- Create login and registration forms and control 
authentication
- Fix bug that html tags will be considered html (audio tags and image tags will work to play audio and show pictures)
- Possibility to put images and audio
